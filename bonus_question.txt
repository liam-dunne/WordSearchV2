Since my algorithm checks row-by-row and column-by-column, different cores could be used to check different rows or columns simultaneously to improve performance.
Alternatively, each core could search for a different word simultaneously.
If the cores are searching for the same word, once one core finds the word, all cores need to stop searching for that word and move to the next.
If the cores are searching for different words, then only the core that finds the word needs to stop and move on to the next word that isn't being searched for.
